3DHe

3D-He is a simple MatlabTM program that should support thermochronologist to accurately and efficiently determine required grain measures for (U-Th)/He dating. 3D-He numerically reconstruct the grain shape of apatite and zircon, and calculate resulting grain measures, such as volume, surface area, sphere-equivalent radii und Ft-correction factors. The reconstruction of the three-dimensional grain shape is based on the interpolation of photomicrographs taken orthogonal to the principal grain axes. The resulting grain model is used to simulate He ejection and diffusion using a coupled Monte Carlo and Brownian motion algorithm. 3D-He is flexible and can handle broken grains or grains with known parent isotope zonation.
